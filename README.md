## Introduction
**Seizure Superstar** is a web app designed to help people with epilepsy have a few less things to worry about. My partner has refractory epilepsy, and this inspired me to design my CS50 Final Project. Although we have a seizure tracking app, that is neat and handy, it only exists as a mobile app and it is not possible to access your data through a web browser. Unfortunately, we have not been able to find a similar app that is web-based.

The initial idea was to make the web app applicable for different chronic conditions. However this was scaled down to just epilepsy in order to be thorough. With additional information about other chronic conditions, the webapp could potentially be reconfigured to help those who suffer from other conditions.

## Features
- [x] Working user creation and user login 
- [x] TLDRepeat:
    - A cloze passage style form for the user to provide their condition and seizure details. 
    - The aim of the form is to consolidate all the most relevant information about the user's condition so that they will not have to keep "repeating the same old story" each and every time they see a new health professional.
    - The data collected from the form can be used to feed the options of the other pages  
    - This will be the first step for the newly registered user.
- [ ] Medison:
    - Simple Calculator that will calculate from the number of remaining pills and daily dosage and display the date a pharmacy run must be done to replenish medication
- [ ] Dr When+
- [ ] Chronolog
