**Chronic Champion** is a web app designed to help people with chronic conditions have a few less things to worry about. The idea for this web application came about as my partner has refractory Epilepsy and although we have a seizure tracking app that is quite neat and handy, it only exists as a mobile app. We have not been able to find one that is web-based.

As a videogame fan, I was initially interested in making a game, however, considering myself to be still of the "less comfortable" group, I desisted. Although *PSET9 Finance* was quite challenging for me and althought I was initially intimidated by it, I believe it really summed up most of the skills acquired during this introductory course. Keeping that in mind I decided that I *can* and should make a web-app, opposed to the other possible projects.
